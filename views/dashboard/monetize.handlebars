    <h3>Setup Payouts To Get Paid On Hryzn</h3>

    <p>
      Hryzn partners with Stripe to handle and secure all payments made on our site. We do our best to uphold our values of creating a
      democratized platform that puts the people first and does not mistreat a user's private information. We do not store sensitive information
      within our systems, such as credit card or bank account info. Transactions all take place through the security of Stripe, and it is necessary
      to setup payouts through Stripe in order to get paid.
